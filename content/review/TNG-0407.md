This is one of the marker episodes. Not easy to forget.

Worf and his mate, K'Ehlar, reunites in a way which is not desired; during a leadership change in Klingon empire.

Duras and Gowron opposes, the situation is plainly showcasing an average and a terrible candidate. So, all the faults happened by Duras. Duras simply was the faulty one. So, the story development seem short-legged but, the items in the development still is a well-fitted one.

Also, an emotional episode indeed. I would talk about Alexander, K'Ehlar's style, Picard's judgement on his involvement to the topic, Duras' lack of character, etc. Lots of opportunities to talk and see the details, with a Trekkie friend.

One observation;

Duras reminded me of an ethnicity in Russia. I don't want to disclose the name, but the similarity is originated from the leaders of this folks like Duras' father. This leader has agreed with Russian government to gain power in his region, then cooperated with Russia government. The society blamed him with betrayal and criticized him explicitly. Then he governed their administration and his son followed.

Like, Klingons became a militaristic society after they've been invaded, this ethnicity just had the disadvantage of the geography, and their character has been impacted by nature, moreover they've been invaded. So, Gene Roddenberry articulated species well from the societies on earth. It's not a fictive story of aliens, but us.
