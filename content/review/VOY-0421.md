Omega molecule, a thread to existence.

Janeway took out the mission and neutralized the threat.

Seems like a waste of opportunity to visit deeper themes and conflicts, still a Star Trek episode.

A woman of science know when to exit. It's okay, but nothing happens after the exit. For example, we didn't learn more about the species who build the molecule, there was no dialogue with them. This is not inspiring nor promising.

It seems just making sense for Seven of Nine to have a spiritual experience.
