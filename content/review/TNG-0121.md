I think TOS is more about the discovery, TNG is more about leadership. Captain Picard did an interesting choice by making Geordi the acting captain, while there are superiors available. In this case, we're both seeing an increased importance of Geordi, and having a chance to observe the development of leadership skills.

Enterprise crew discovers a planet with no person living but with active transmission. They found out, an autonomous weapon-dealer AI system is the source of activity and the reason of no living person.

I remember the regulatory processes I deal with in the products I managed. The regulatory landscape in the world has two different paradigms; [Laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) and "Throttle Innovation" in the sake of safety.

Weaponry is certainly an area of safety, but our approaches and holy worlds of personal rights, man-made constitutional laws, sometimes restricts us on thinking logically. So in that case, "the arsenal of freedom" is likely to happen in our world. So it seems not like a far-distant fiction.

In some of the real near-history examples, some powers of hidden governments stocked lots of weaponry to facilitate a way of government-led civil resistance force when required. Lots of the occasions has ended with the empowerment of the evil forces and the weaponry served not to defend but to destruct.

Yes, some items are not making sense in the episode but, the message makes sense at least. It's not far to our current understanding.
