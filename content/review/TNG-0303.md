## Thoughts

Wow!

* Imagining that, what if we were able to do what we'll do just by imagining. Would it be just so effortless, like we're thinking now? Or would it be like a muscular effort, which require similar energy?
* Certainly, it's wonderful to imagine, how a man can impact megawatts of energy just by thought, it's fiction. But what's not fiction is we cannot understand this power. I mean, in similar contexts.
* Picard was right when he said that they're not the judges who can judge that man. "We have no law to fit your crime."
* Conscience is the best lawmaker.
