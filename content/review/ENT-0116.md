A nice filler episode. Again, happening in a shuttle. In Star Trek, shuttle-themed episodes has an interesting reality. In the most resourceful place of starships, it's difficult to see challenging scenes while shuttles are vulnerable. So, shuttle-episodes are generally performing well on small story developments.

We saw cold-British Malcolm's internal world where he finally founds a place of belonging. And Tucker's reactions towards him.
