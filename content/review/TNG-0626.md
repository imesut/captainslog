Wow, a valuable work of storytelling!

Fascinating and a fluent flow; interconnected stories from the history concluded with a hopeful message.

Lore brings a nazistic mission to individualized Borgs; destroying non-artificial life forms, and creating a kind of eugenics.

Multi-directed thoughts within the freed Borgs, triggers a leadership crisis. As like as humans without a purpose (feeling) in life, they also ended up with existential crisis, in this case with some additions of undesired outcomes. So it's a real key message to carry out a meaning or purpose while preserving individual perspective, meaning is not a catalyzer thing, but an existential aspect.

Lore and Data tells us a story under some similarities;

* Lore has a strong willing and ability to create
* Lore lacks self-control - conscience (ethical subroutines) like Data
* Data can make logic and progressive ideas, but he's not in the front, he's in the supportive role.
* As Data becomes more human, or develops himself, he took leadership opportunities a real development to all.

I don't know, how much Gene Roddenberry has designed the Data - Lore concepts, but these two brothers gave us some thoughtful moments to consider the power of emotions to drive something, and the power of logic & ethics to drive the driver.

Their analogy is not like a gas-brake analogy but more like an elephant driver analogy. And I suggest taking a look to Elephant & Driver mental model in this case.

The story turned the tide by following two moment, which both of them are worth thinking;

1\. Georgi and Picard were able to trigger Data's ethical routines, by causing a reset; which means with just a tiny touch, a human can be reset into a thoughtful situation.

2\. Riker and Worf has been caught by Hugh's team and involved them into the situation. Thanks to the credit of early encounter where Picard choose to give a new possibility to Hugh. It's kind of the power of networking.

Plusses;

* Episode starts with a game play around a table with Data and fathers of Physics; including Hawking played by him. Fascinating!
* Georgi is not just a sincere friend to Mr. Data; he's good with all artificial life forms, and engineers, and introverts :) Nice to see that.
* Captain's Chair is inspiring, even the Doctor was able to make bold moves and took out the chances. :)
* This episode make sense to me, I asked AI to create a moment of "Data's conscience reset" with the touch of his friends. Here is the image;
