Our doctor, a primary matrix as superior Qomarians says, seems to find their meaningful pursuit in life. But he displays an early decision to a society which cannot comprehend and appreciate him.

We see a joyful example of humanification of doctor. Choice freedom and ability to love becomes primary concerns.

A light and filler episode.

Some Points;

1. To make the production easier, the scene of perform, is the same with Q's judgement saloon.
2. Actually our LLMs, large language models like ChatGPT, are just matrix operations. So at the entrance of the episode, Qomarians reminds us that aspect. Still, LLMs can talk like human. So, do they actually gain choice freedom? Even so, it might be an illusion. Wait! Is it same for us?
