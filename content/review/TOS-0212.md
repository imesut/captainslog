I totally enjoy McCoy's senses and amusing persona.

The episode starts with McCoy's feeling about Norman, he was behaving strange and was not visiting the Doctor's office for checks. Spock replies; *"He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles."* This is certainly an amusing and human reply!

## Story Development

A Humanoid species in the Andromeda Galaxy has created Android helpers for themselves. Androids call these species as Makers. [Makers](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Makers) has some outposts in some of the planets rather than their own.

A supernova of their sun has caused the species to extinct. And some of the Androids survived, placed in other planets. One of the Androids (Norman) has transformed a planet into a planet of Androids. And he created Androidic life. Norman is the coordinator of other Androids.

Androids wear a necklace functioning as an error-correcting unit, like [Watchdog Timers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer). And Norman controls the central unit of coordination.

Harry Mudd, has escaped from one of the Federation's jail and developed a plan to catch a starship with the help of Androids. Norman executes a plan to bring the Enterprise crew to the planet Mudd. Enterprise crew analyses the androids weak and strong spots and develop a plan to malfunction their error-correcting units from central place.

The enterprise crew plays a theatrical scene to illustrate illogical moments and break the causality loop and put the central unit into [infinite loop.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop)

## Some Points

* The play at the end was interesting. The act was between theatrical and cinematic. During the 60s, it's natural to apply these techniques in series and movies. In today's CGI-rich environment, we cannot expect these examples. So, it's a pleasure to witness these transitional examples. (Today is another day to appreciate TOS series.ðŸ––)
* Robots say; you're self-destructive species. We should control you for your own safety, and we should serve you for your wellbeing; It makes sense.
* Robots say that Harry Mudd have them a purpose, they lacked for a long time. In fact, it's the opportunity he gave. Norman is the chief strategist and executioner.
* It seems like TOS didn't envision about security cameras. The enterprise crew couldn't find the intruder at the beginning. A security camera system might make things difficult for the intruder. This all related with the zeitgeist of the era. Roddenberry foresee technological breakthroughs but didn't foresee a security camera system, why; zeitgeist.

## Some Thoughts

* Android's central unit approach and their willingness to protect the species seems like a preliminary version of [#Borgs](/tags/borg). They're appreciative of their Makers' wisdom. They might focus on bringing the wisdom or perfection more and evolve into a Borg-ic way. Even they might be the origin of Borg. The origin of the Borg is unknown, but who knows?
* Kirk mentions royalty fee for patents. In the year of 2268, did patent term still exist in Federation? Or did Kirk mention other planet's status. Because Star Trek's Federation was a money-less civilization. Also, I don't believe, patents will exist [in near future (My Blog Post).](https://mesut.me/blog/patent-deist/)
