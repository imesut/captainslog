## Thoughts

Intro

* Seven of Nine character designed carefully, it's full of emotion without reflecting. Under the poker face of Seven, her cracked voice tells a lot.
* Borg episodes are always interesting. The atmosphere and the story development is designed to compete with other Sci-Fi works, before the Borg concept, Star Trek was less adventurous when compared with others.
* The baby at the end was a nice touch, may we see its future in the following series?
