An interesting start to the season with references to progenitors.

And lots of poor points;

1. Kovich has more authority than admiral; it's quite difficult to understand, in the history of Starfleet, there were admirals who can keep the classified missions. So that means, Kovich is having a quite opposing situation where none of the admirals can be trusted like any before. But at the end of the episode, Kovich can disclose the purpose or at least the intention easily to Captain Michael. Both contrary to the power hierarchy in Starfleet and a well-designed story development.

Yes, captains might own the purpose better than their superiors, but if they've been informed well than superiors, that means superiors are suspected persons. So I see this is a conflicted point made while trying  to make the episode interesting.

1. I don't know what's happening with Western producers. They're misusing green-screens all wrong. In the most action-full moments, characters are able to talk easily; the only difficulty is their hearing because of the noise level.

The art of acting has been defeated by the misused of computer technology. If there was no green-screen method used, players and decoration team would like to reflect the situations better with scene and acting.
