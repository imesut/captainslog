A prime directive episode; crew forgot a device in pre-warp society, tries to recover "the Communicator". During attempts, crew risks their lives in the sake of prime directive.

Not a novel approach as previous examples before. Prime-directive topic has been handled in so much fancy details before.

Still, T'pol's personality puts us into an intertwined feelings towards her.
