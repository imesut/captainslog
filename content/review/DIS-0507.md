We're learning more about the Breen society and getting some clarity. L'ak has gained an importance as a key to the throne for his uncle. But he seems to be dead at the end of the episode. Also we learn the details of Breen - Kellerun invade history. And we can see how (ex-Captain) First Officer Rayner has been affected.

By considering the Breen threat, Federation has previously encountered with massive threats; `Klingons > Romulans > Borg > Breen`

The most powerful one was certainly the Borg. Only Borgs didn't get allied with the Federation, because they were not a specie or nation but assimilated ones. Still, Federation has had an influence on them to earn Drones (assimilated Borg individuals) their freedom.

So, how can a captain shouldn't be resourceful and willing to ally and initiate diplomacy?

Also, I've noticed something during the episode;

* In the last series, they're using less stardates, they're using more earth dates. I don't know, it loses the sense in a way. In the previous series, the crew was more from Earth, and in the later series crew became more diverse from other planets. So they should've been continuing to use stardates.

> For quick reference, stardate and earth-date can be converted roughly like below;\
> `Stardate = (EarthYear - 2323) * 1000`

* Adira will be like Wesley Crusher (in [TOS](/tags/TOS)) to the Discovery crew.
