Is human better than Cardassian, when they lack order (resourcefulness)?

Dr. Bashir and Commander Sisko find themselves in time travel to the point of humanity is about to have a spinoff in terms of social dynamics, justice.

In the time, humanity has some detention / gatherings camp. And it doesn't seem like a friendly time.

In this episode, we see that, Star Trek not just sees the future, but analyses the moment and wishes a better alternative. And that's a kind of opportunity to imagine what current situations might be altered to.

Kind of nostalgic or futuristic; nostalgiscits?
