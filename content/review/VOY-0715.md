I guess, the best story development examples from Star Trek are 2-part stories like this one. These example capture the generic Sci-Fi lover audience. Still, Star Trek should distinguish itself from generic Sci-Fi.

In Workforce, Voyager crew captured by a group then their memory is altered, then they've been moved to a workforce need in a planet which heavily need workforce. I remember the Apple TV's Severance series, where employee's memory becomes segmented, and their civil and business memory do not interfere.

Our crew gone through some challenges to be united against the guys, then at the end they've been escaped. Moreover, we see some examples which comply with Star Trek values, it's not an issue of being freed as a team; but to make it persistent for all;

* The young doctor's truth-seeking and challenging the senior doctor (the result is not important, he might be under the influence of his seniors)
* The end; Voyager crew reports the incident and guilty doctors / bureaucrats.

Some points make me smile;

* The dialogues of Kim and Holo-doctor: Even doctor wants to be in command division instead of medical. Humans' will-power is universal. :)
* "Fraternization"; not permitted in Workforce. :)
