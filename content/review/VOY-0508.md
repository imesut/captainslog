Excellent, it hit the nerves! A fascinating work of ethical debates, story development and adventure.

When you use a killer's knowledge to make something thrive, do you make a sin, make the humanity less good?

On the contrary, do you take the chances to maximum possibilities?

In the end, I'm thinking using the work is not ethical, and assuming that, using knowledge from unethical experimentations will lead to more unethical work is kind of putting humanity and conscience like a toddler's seat. While we're imagining humanity will take a step forward, how we can imagine that humanity will behave like conditioned animals at the same time?

The re-use of unethical work might be the only chance to purify it. So using it and adding a footnote as Doctor mentioned might not be a harm.

A nice episode, which hit my nerves, triggers thoughts...
