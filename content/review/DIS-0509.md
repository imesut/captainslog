**Story Development**

Progenitors' Technology is staying at the [Lagrange point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) of two giant.

Breens and Discovery team reaches to the point at the same time. Breen gets the container which stores the technology.

Discovery deploys a plan to retrieve it.

An episode of salt-action. I couldn't find so much to think about it, I feel blank.
