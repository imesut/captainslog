I love TNG's parallel storytelling, if the scenario is not so intense and adventurous, they develop parallel stories in common themes, and it brings a fluency and calm to the scene.

While Wesley Crusher is being tested, the Picard has been, too.

While Crusher has faced with the scenario which his father died in it, Picard also faced some of the points which he bent the rules and been asked for it. The difference was Picard's seniority in this case.

So taking the accounts of what has happened might be one of the biggest challenges. As Wesley crashed in the first test, let's not fail in the following one.

Aha, Wesley Crasher? :)

Actually no, the other guys with the same voice with Wesley was about the crash, literally. So the scenario has tripled the parallel stories.

The thing to remind Star Trek value here, is being accountable of what has been happened. Bringing calm to personal and common history is valuable!
