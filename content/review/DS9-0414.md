## The Story, Briefly

Kira and Gul Dukat has a short trip, in which they discover their similarities and feel the power of achieving (conquering) things.

Name of the episode: "Return to Grace" is for the moment as Kira convinces Ducat to not march toward Klingons to attack them, instead being reasonable. (Does it really mean grace=logical? Because at that moment, the logical decision was not to attack.)

Or it might be the moment of taking Dukat's girl to the station, in this case Grace=Station.

## Thoughts

Story development is kind of didactic and unsurprising from the beginning; it's not just usual to Star Trek fans, anyone might guess it from the beginning.

* Does Nerys & Dukat couple might be a possibility to consider?
* Why Klingons attack at the beginning? It's not covered or asked in any way. Grace should mean reaching to the meaning.
