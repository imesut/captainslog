Things happen when Janeway and Chakotay has to be in a planet, separated from their crew.

Kind of a filler episode.

We again see the attraction between Janeway and Chakotay, we see another example of trusting your enemy, and seeing again the example of rediscovery.

Humanity re-discover because cannot share discoveries freely. One of the thing is Vidiians' cure to the disease, the barrier to share it freely in terms of keeping the power...\
\
The episode has a flaw in story development; Tuvok easily believe Vidiian doctor to lower the shield. It might be a planned action from Vidiians. So there were a few opportunities to build a tradeoff to make the story appealing; these are missed.
