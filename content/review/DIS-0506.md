Wow! Now we're talking about the new season. Finally they catch the sprit.

Discovery crew visits a pre-warp society's planet for the next tip of the key of Progenitor's tech.

The folks has a whistle-language for communicating from far distances. After 2300s, whistle-language might seem ancient, but today it's still [continuing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language).

This society even has some figures; Mother Compeer is looking for water like Ishmael's mother's [Hagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagar "Hagar"). And this makes this episode similar to some [TOS](/tags/tos) episode which takes analogies from [Rome](/tags/rome) Imperium. This topic has raised my mood and I feel, this season has started to make sense.

At the beginning of the episode, Michael mentions this society's 3-gender norm (which we didn't see, and we understand it's not a biological one), and closes the episode with her saying to the priest (who saw the Federation technology);

> Beliefs can evolve. Denying that can cause almost as much chaos as the worst storm.

When prime-directive is risked by revealing identities of the Federation or its tech, captains chose a way to describe the situation to the reasonable character from that planet. Their caring approach to that individuals beliefs are worth appreciation.\

I didn't think this season would inspire me in a way, but it did. I'm expecting more episodes like this.
