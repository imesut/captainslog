Zefram Cochrane was not dead, at the date of Enterprise's encounter with this phenomenon.

An electric-based life-form saves Cochrane and keeps him in an immortal state. As Cochrane started to feel lonely, the life-form finds Enterprise's shuttle during their march to the rendezvous point with the ship.

By putting a mirror to the life-form, Enterprise team shows that, keeping Cochrane immortal is not a helpful motive at all.

Luckily, life-form is a wise one and develops an understanding.

Not so much to consider.
