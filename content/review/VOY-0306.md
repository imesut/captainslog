Voyager crew makes a trip with Enarans, who're a telepathic species, who can share memories (unlike Vulcan's mind-meld they don't have to touch)

Enarans has some regrets from their personal histories. Some societal sins towards "Regressives". But at the end, which society don't have similar sins? The feeling of threat had caused all the societies to massacre, eugenics, rewrite the history...

We're humans we saw this in history, and we even see similar today; while all the globe witnessing the situation, ethnical cleansing has never been decelerated.

We're humans, we saw this in our nature. Star Trek is imagining the potential of the humanity, not its nature or history, but its future and possibilities. This became one of the episodes which couldn't gap the bridge between reality and possibility.
