Criterias builds the overall score by multiplying and normalizing to 100 scale. The perfect episode is ðŸ’¯, the worst one is 0.

1. **Star Trek Values:** The more an episode reflects the purpose and values of the Star Trek, itâ€™s more Star Trek.
2. **Inspiring:** Values are important, but should not tell in the way of didacticism, it should inspire us towards future, believing in humanityâ€™s future, direct us to imagine whatâ€™s possible.
3. **Story Development:** Values + Inspiration combination is working well, unless it catches our attention and touches to our senses of reality. Low fiction quality can be an issue to watch and consume the message, so Iâ€™m considering the fictional quality here. The flow of the episode should feel realistic when we assume weâ€™re living in that era.
